This repository contains a deep learning project where we've trained a ResNet model to detect pneumonia from X-ray images.

## Introduction
Pneumonia is a common lung infection caused by various microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to aid healthcare professionals in the timely and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia using X-ray images.

## Dataset
We utilized the [Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2) Dataset for the project. <br> 
This dataset consists of 5840 X-ray images, labeled as 'Pneumonia' or 'Normal'.

Total Images: 5840 <br>
Training Set: 5216 images <br> 
Validation Set: 312 images <br> 
Test Set: 312 images <br> 
### Requirements
Python 3.x <br> 
TensorFlow 2.x <br> 

Results
Our trained ResNet model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Here are some of the results:
